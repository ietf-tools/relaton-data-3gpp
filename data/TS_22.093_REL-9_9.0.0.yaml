abstract:
- content: "In the situation when subscriber A encounters a network determined user
    busy (NDUB) destination B, the subscriber A can request the CCBS supplementary
    service (i.e. activate a CCBS request against destination B). The network will
    then monitor the wanted destination B for becoming idle.\r\nWhen the wanted destination
    B becomes idle, then the network will wait a short time in order to allow destination
    B to make an outgoing call. If destination B does not make any outgoing call within
    this time, then the network shall automatically recall subscriber A."
