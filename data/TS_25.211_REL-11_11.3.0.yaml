abstract:
- content: This specification describes the characteristics of the Layer 1 transport
    channels and physical channels in the FDD mode of UTRA. The main objectives of
    the specification are to be a part of the full description of the UTRA Layer 1,
    and to serve as a basis for the drafting of the actual technical specification
    (TS).
