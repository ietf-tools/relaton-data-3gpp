abstract:
- content: This specification describes the radio frequency (RF) test methods and
    conformance requirements for UTRA base transceiver stations (BTS) operating in
    the TDD mode. These have been derived from, and are consistent with, the core
    UTRA specifications specified in the requirements reference sub-clause of each
    test. The maximum acceptable measurement uncertainty is specified in the TS for
    each test, where appropriate.
