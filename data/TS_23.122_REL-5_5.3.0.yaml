- content: This specification shall give an overview of the tasks undertaken by a
    Mobile Station (MS) when in idle mode, that is, switched on but not having a dedicated

    mode, that is, receiving a group call or broadcast call but not having a dedicated
    connection. It also describes the corresponding network functions.
