abstract:
- content: This specification describes the RLP for data transmission over the UMTS
    public land mobile network (PLMN). RLP covers the Layer 2 functionality of the
    ISO OSI reference model (IS 7498). It is based on ideas contained in IS 3309,
    IS 4335 and IS 7809 (HDLC of ISO) as well as ITU-T Recommendations X.25, Q.921
    and Q.922 (LAP-B and LAP-D, respectively). RLP has been tailored to the special
    needs of digital radio transmission. RLP provides to its users the OSI data link
    service (IS 8886).
