abstract:
  content: This specification describes the Stage 1 description of the SAT primarily
    from the subscriber’s and serving environment’s points of view, and does not deal
    with the details of the human interface itself. It includes information applicable
    to network operators, serving environments and terminal, switch and database manufacturers
    and contains the core requirements for a SAT which are sufficient to provide a
    complete service.
