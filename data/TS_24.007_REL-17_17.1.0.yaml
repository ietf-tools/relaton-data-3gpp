abstract:
- content: This specification describes the principal architecture of Layer 3 and
    its sub-layers on the GSM Um interface, i.e. the interface between mobile station
    (MS) and network; for the CM sub-layer, the description is restricted to paradigmatic
    examples, CC, supplementary services, and short message services for non-general
    packet radio service (GPRS) services. It also defines the basic message format
    and error handling applied by the Layer 3 protocols.
