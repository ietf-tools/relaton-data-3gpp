abstract:
- content: This document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and conformance
    requirements for UTRA User Equipment (UE) operating in the FDD mode. These have
    been derived from, and are consistent with, the core UTRA specifications. The
    maximum acceptable measurement uncertainty is specified in the TS for each test,
    where appropriate.
