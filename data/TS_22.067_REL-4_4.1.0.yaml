abstract:
- content: 'This specification describes the Stage 1 description of the enhanced multi-level
    precedence and pre-emption (eMLPP) service. This service has two parts: precedence
    and pre-emption. Precedence involves assigning a priority level to a call in combination
    with fast call set-up. Pre-emption involves the seizing of resources, which are
    in use by a call of a lower precedence, by a higher level precedence call in the
    absence of idle resources. Pre-emption can also involve the disconnection of an
    on-going call of lower precedence to accept an incoming call of higher precedence.'
