abstract:
- content: This specification describes the RF test methods and conformance requirements
    for UTRA base transceiver stations (BTS) operating in the FDD mode. These have
    been derived from, and are consistent with, the core UTRA specifications specified
    in the requirements reference subclause of each test. The maximum acceptable measurement
    uncertainty is specified in the TS for each test, where appropriate.
