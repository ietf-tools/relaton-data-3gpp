abstract:
- content: This document describes the numbering system for Application IDentifiers
    (AID) for 3G telecommunication Integrated Circuits (IC) card applications. The
    numbering system provides a means for an application and related services offered
    by a provider to identify if a given card contains the elements required by its
    application and related services.
