abstract:
- content: The feature operator determined barring (ODB) allows the network operator
    or service provider to regulate, by means of an exceptional procedure, access
    by the subscribers to 3G services, by the barring of certain categories of outgoing
    or incoming calls or of roaming. ODB shall take effect immediately and shall terminate
    ongoing calls and bar future calls. The purpose of this network feature is to
    be able to limit the service provider’s financial exposure to new subscribers,
    or to those who have not promptly paid their bills. It may only be applied to
    the service provider’s own subscribers.
