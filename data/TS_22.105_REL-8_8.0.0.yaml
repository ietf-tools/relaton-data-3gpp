abstract:
- content: Pre-UMTS systems have largely standardized the complete sets of bearer
    services, teleservices and supplementary services which they provide. One major
    difference between UMTS and pre-UMTS systems is that service capabilities rather
    than services are standardized for UMTS, allowing service differentiation and
    system continuity. This document describes how and what kind of services the UMTS
    user has access to.
