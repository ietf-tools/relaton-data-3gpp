abstract:
- content: "MSP is an optional service to enable mobile subscribers to have several
    profiles associated with a single subscriber identity (SIM) and a single international
    mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), with each profile being a subscription option.
    Each profile may be used for mobile originated and mobile terminated calls. \r\nUp
    to four different profiles can be provisioned against a subscriber using the MSP
    feature. This will allow the subscriber to separate her telecommunication service
    needs into different identities (e.g. business and home)."
