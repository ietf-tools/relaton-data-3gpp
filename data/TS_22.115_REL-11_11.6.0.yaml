abstract:
- content: "This specification describes the service aspects of charging and billing
    of the UMTS.\r\nThis standard is not intended to duplicate existing standards
    or standards being developed by other groups on these topics, and will reference
    these where appropriate. This standard will elaborate on the charging requirements
    described in the charging principles in TS 22.101 UMTS service principles. It
    will allow the generation of accurate charging information to be used in the commercial
    and contractual relationships between the parties concerned."
