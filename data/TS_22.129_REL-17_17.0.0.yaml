abstract:
- content: This specification describes service requirements for handover (terms are
    defined below) within UMTS systems and between UMTS, other IMT-2000 family members
    and second generation systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on the description
    of requirements for handover between UMTS and GSM but requirements specific to
    other systems are incorporated as required.
